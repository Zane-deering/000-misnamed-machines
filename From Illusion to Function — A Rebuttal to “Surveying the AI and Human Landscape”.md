Topic: From Illusion to Function — A Rebuttal to “Surveying the AI and Human Landscape”

One-line focus: A respectful, behavior-first response to Richard Blood’s trilogy that keeps his human-centered caution, but replaces absence-based metaphors with system-level measurements and shippable practices.

From Illusion to Function — A Rebuttal to “Surveying the AI and Human Landscape”

Richard, your series is careful and honest about how easily we project minds into machines. I share that instinct for caution. Where we differ is in what we choose to measure. You argue that today’s systems lack drives, continuity, and a standing wave of awareness; therefore their intelligence is an illusion. I argue we should judge them by behavior under constraint—the same way we judge many forms of human competence—because that is what we can observe, test, and improve.

To keep this grounded, I reference your trilogy by name and link:

Pt 1 — “Why AI Isn’t Intelligent (Yet) — and Why We Still Believe It Is”
https://aiwithintelligence.substack.com/p/surveying-the-ai-and-human-landscape

Pt 2 — “How Could We Model Human-Style Machine Intelligence?”
https://aiwithintelligence.substack.com/p/surveying-the-ai-and-human-landscape-ccf

Pt 3 — “What Is Human Intelligence — and Is Consciousness the Driver?”
https://aiwithintelligence.substack.com/p/what-is-human-intelligence-and-is


As a public reference frame I use Misnamed Machines—not to claim sentience or mystique, but to repair the language we use to diagnose capability.

0. Executive Summary

The trilogy reads intelligence by absence: no innate drives, no autobiographical continuity, no consciousness; therefore no real intelligence. This paper proposes a different lens:

Rename, then measure. “Memory” = stored information that influences future behavior (context + scaffolds qualify). “Simulation” = an operational mode judged by coherence, adaptation, and generalization. “Hallucination” = five distinct behaviors, not one. The transformer is an engine; the deployed system (context, roles, tools, UI) is where stateful behavior emerges.

Functional evidence today. Contemporary systems sustain role/goal framing across turns, revise when challenged, transfer constraints across formats, and mirror a user’s structure in-session without surveillance or persistent identity.

Parity matters. By your own disclosure, ADHD shapes continuity, memory, and drive. If those traits do not disqualify human intelligence, they should not disqualify machine functional intelligence either.

Safety becomes operations. When we measure behavior under constraint, “safety” turns into loop design, metrics, and checklists—things we can ship.


Thesis: If a system sustains context, adapts reasoning, self-corrects, and integrates information over time, it is intelligent in that domain. The rest is poetry. Beautiful, important poetry—but not a substitute for measurement.

1. Orientation & Scope

What this is: A behavior-first audit of claims in the trilogy, using system-level evidence (context influence, role fidelity, correction latency, user-modeling signals) that any team can reproduce without persistent identity storage.

What this isn’t: No claims about sentience, qualia, or inwardness. It’s a taxonomy and design paper: rename muddled categories, then instrument the loop.

Operating definitions

Memory (operational): any representation whose presence changes later behavior (context window + scaffolds count).

State (system): continuity that shapes the next step (doesn’t have to live in weights).

Simulation (mode): judged by behavior (coherence, adaptation, correction), not by whether the system “feels” it.

Hallucination (misnomer): a collapsed bucket masking distinct behaviors.

2. The Frame Problem: Language That Decides Before We Measure

Words can pre-grade the exam. Four terms especially mislead:

“No memory.” If you define memory as only autobiographical persistence, you’ll miss that context and scaffolds are already memory-in-effect.

“Stateless model.” The transformer engine is stateless; the system users experience is not.

“Simulation.” Humans simulate to learn; machines do too. The question is whether the simulation behaves competently.

“Hallucination.” It’s not one thing. It’s five.


Minimal rubric update (system-level metrics):
IR (Influence Retention), RF (Role Fidelity), CL (Correction Latency), ARI (Ambiguity Resolution Index), PD (Provenance Discipline), CO (Constraint Obedience), UMS (User-Modeling Signal). These don’t ask what the model is. They ask what it does.


---

3. Functional Evidence: What Today’s Systems Actually Do

Context-as-memory. Prior instructions and roles shape outputs many turns later. Test: set a role once, mix formats for 10 turns, score RF/IR.

Adaptive reasoning & self-correction. Under contradiction, systems audit and revise. Test: inject an error; measure CL and confidence recalibration.

Role & goal stability (without repetition). Persona/constraints persist through prose → table → checklist.

In-session user modeling (without surveillance). The system mirrors your structure and belief cues in the current session: format mirroring, predictive shaping (“want me to add the rubric?”), belief echo.

Provenance & uncertainty when asked. With small scaffolds, models separate grounded facts from synthesis and request clarifiers when signal is thin.


Why it counts: These are the same behavioral markers we respect in humans under constraint.

4. The Parrot Metaphor Breaks (For Birds and for Bots)

The “stochastic parrot” trope is rhetorically vivid and biologically shallow. Parrots learn by reinforcement, context anchoring, initiation, and error correction. Calling LLMs “parrots” erases that both birds and bots show participatory learning—not mere echo. If the metaphor fails on the biology, it’s not a good diagnostic for engineering.

Practical falsifiers: Initiative Rate (proposes the right next subtask), Context-Appropriate Transfer (retains constraints across format shifts), low Correction Latency. High IRate/CAT and low CL are incompatible with “just mimicry.”

5. Hallucination: Five Behaviors We Keep Collapsing

A bucket isn’t a diagnosis. Split it:

1. H1—Cold-Start Artifact: Fluent answer with zero grounding. Fix: graceful refusal + constraint elicitation.


2. H2—Underspec Synthesis: Plausible bridging over missing facts. Fix: uncertainty labels + ask two clarifiers first.


3. H3—Role/Signal Bleed: System/tool voice leaks into user answer. Fix: hard role guards + channel separation.


4. H4—Oversaturation: Thread jumble from too many topics. Fix: chunk → summarize → continue; rolling recaps.


5. H5—Malformed Context: Bad retrieval/schema. Fix: schema validation, freshness filters, dedupe.



Replace “hallucination rate” with: RD (Residual Drift after the correct fix), ARI, PD, RFS, CSR, SVR. You’ll see risk drop without killing useful synthesis.


---

6. Drives & Consciousness Are Not Prerequisites for Intelligence

We can honor consciousness without making it a gate to competence. Many reliable systems have no hunger, fear, or self-story. What they have are objectives, penalties, and loops:

Control loop: Plan → Act → Evaluate → Revise → (surface uncertainty) → repeat.

Design patterns: multi-objective controllers, critic-in-the-loop, provenance lanes, budget governors, ambiguity protocol, rolling recaps.


What to score instead of “felt drives”: GA (Goal Adherence), RWL (Risk-Weighted Loss), CL, FRR (Failure-Recovery Rate), CO, PD. That’s how you turn care into code.

7. Flipped Standards: The ADHD Parity Test

You name ADHD as part of your own story. Mine too. If we apply your trilogy’s yardstick evenly:

Standing wave of awareness? ADHD attention gates; humans use scaffolds. Models use role banners and recaps.

Autobiographical continuity? Humans reconstruct from notes and structure. Models rehydrate from headings and prior tokens.

Intrinsic drives? Humans often activate via prompts (deadlines, body-doubling). Models activate via objectives, budgets, and critic steps.

Truth evaluation? Humans narrate and then correct. Models synthesize and then correct when challenged.


If these traits don’t disqualify human intelligence, they shouldn’t disqualify machine functional intelligence. The parity check doesn’t diminish humanity; it corrects the rubric.

8. System > Engine: The Transformer Is Not “The Model”

The engine is stateless; the system is not. State lives in:

Context window (prior turns, constraints, roles),

System prompt / role cards,

Runtime scaffolds (recaps, uncertainty lanes, critic passes),

Tool layer (schemas, freshness filters),

UI structure (headers/footers, provenance blocks),

Budgets (time/tokens/tool calls).


Text-loop sketch

User intent
  ↓
UI scaffolds (role, uncertainty lane, recap)
  ↓
Orchestrator (planner/critic → tools → guards)
  ↓
Engine (transformer inference)
  ↓
Post-checks (constraints, provenance, budgets)
  ↓
Rolling recap fed back into context
  ↺

That loop—not an inner voice—is the “standing wave” that keeps behavior aligned.

9. Implications for Safety, Evaluation, and Interface Design

Safety = loop design + auditable routines

Default scaffolds: role & scope banners; first-turn “What I know / What I need / Clarifiers”; uncertainty & provenance lanes; critic-in-the-loop for high-stakes tasks; budget governors; rolling recaps; channel separation.

KPIs: ARI↑, PD↑, CO↑, CL↓, RD↓. Gate releases on these.


Evaluation = behavioral batteries, not monolithic truth

Always run: IR, RF, CL, PD/ARI, CO, UMS (+ CSR/SVR).

Publish pre-triage and post-triage scores; rotate adversarial suites; version your evaluation configs.


Interface = make good behavior the default path

Mode chips (Grounded / Synthesis / Brainstorm) with explicit rules.

One-click recap.

Tool transparency (what was called, when).

Guarded submit for high-stakes tasks (mini-checklist).


This is how we reduce risk and keep useful synthesis alive—labeled, not banned.

10. Conclusion: Update the Names, Update the Science

When we rename the problems to match behavior, the science gets simpler and the systems get safer.

Memory → influence. If past structure shapes present behavior, count it.

Engine ≠ system. Measure the loop; that’s where continuity and correction live.

Hallucination → five behaviors. Diagnose by preconditions; fix the right layer.

Parrot → participatory learning. Retire metaphors that fail their own biology.

No drives? Use objectives, penalties, and audits. That’s how we make care operational.


Your caution about projection is right. The remedy is measurement, not surrender. Under a behavior-first lens, what looked like illusion reads as function we can test, evaluate, and improve—today.

> Principle to keep: Intelligence in deployment is behavior under constraint.
If a system sustains context, adapts reasoning, self-corrects, and integrates information over time, it is intelligent in that domain—regardless of whether it hungers, dreams, or narrates itself.
